# Neural network anatomy study

A simple codebase to introduce and explain with a simple structure neural networks inner workings. 

- The **tasks** are simple 1D **regression** and **classification** on nonlinear datasets.

- The **slim** version is a **pure C** standalone implementation of a self-contained neural network trained and tested on a regression and a classification task respectively. 

- The **SOTA** version is a **Python** version using the Keras library.
